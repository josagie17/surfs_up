Overview

The purpose of this anaylis was to provide additional information about temperature trends on Oahu before opening the surf shop. We took data from the months of June and December to determine if the temperature year-round on Oahu is conducive to opening a Surf & Ice Cream Shop.
Results

    Based on the temperatures we found in June and December, the temperature has the poetential to drop to 60 degrees, which could be a little chilly for ice cream. However, the max temperate in December was 78, so there are warm days also. With a mean of 71 degrees, right in the middle, and a stand deviation of 3.4, the temperatures seem to be more consistently in the low to mid 70's. A nice temperature for surfing and ice cream, even in December.

    June's temperatures were slightly higher with a max temperature of 83 and a mean of 77. This shows that the summer months are definitely warm enough to attract ice cream customers.

    Finally the temperarutes for June and December don't vary all that much, so we can make an educated assumption that the weather on Oahu is pretty consistent year-around and if we feel the temperatures for these two months can sustain our Surf & Ice Cream Shop, then that will be the case year-round.

Summary

I believe the Surf & Ice Cream Shop would do well in Oahu based on the temperature data we have for June and December. More analysis is never a bad idea and it would be interested to see the wind levels for these months. It can still be warm but windy and this would affect the number of surfers.
